# CaPTk2:  Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (2nd Gen)

This is a work-in-progress towards integrating [CaPTk](https://github.com/CBICA/CaPTk) algorithms into the [MITK](http://mitk.org/wiki/MITK) framework.

CaPTk2 is developed and maintained by the [Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA)](https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with [German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html).
